## 3. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

### 3.1 Account Balance Logic
```
Starting Balance: $0

When fees applied:
  Account Balance = Current Balance - Fee Amount
  (Negative balance = member owes money)

When payment received:
  Account Balance = Current Balance + Payment Amount

Balance Status:
  Positive = Credit/overpayment
  Zero = Fully paid
  Negative = Outstanding amount owed
```

### 3.2 New Member Joining Fees

**Joining Fee Structure:**
- Standard joining fee: $25 (adjustable in settings)
- Juniors 10-18: No joining fee
- Colts (Aug-Dec only): $50
- Life/Honorary: No joining fee

**Pro-Rata Subscription Schedule (August 2024 to February 2025):**

| Month | Calculation | Example (Full Member) |
|-------|------------|----------------------|
| August | (8 months/12) × Annual + $25 | $325 + $25 = $350 |
| September | (7 months/12) × Annual + $25 | $300 + $25 = $325 |
| October | (6 months/12) × Annual + $25 | $275 + $25 = $300 |
| November | (5 months/12) × Annual + $25 | $225 + $25 = $250 |
| December | (4 months/12) × Annual + $25 | $195 + $25 = $220 |
| January/February | Joining fee only | $100 (no 2024/2025 subscription) |

**New Member Process:**
1. Enter member details
2. System auto-calculates: joining fee + pro-rata subscription
3. Display calculated amount with option to override
4. Add total to member's account balance
5. Member pays (record as separate payment transaction)

### 3.3 Annual Fee Application (February)

**Process:**
1. Administrator initiates "Apply Annual Fees" for specified year
2. System identifies all Active members
3. For each member:
   - Determines correct category based on current age
   - Looks up corresponding annual fee
   - Adds fee to account balance
   - Records transaction in fee charges log
4. Display summary: members charged, total fees applied
5. Prevent duplicate application for same year

### 3.4 Payment Recording

**Payment Information:**
- Member selection (search by name)
- Payment date
- Amount
- Payment method (Bank Transfer or Cash)
- Reference/notes field (for bank references, special notes)

**Payment Patterns Supported:**
- Full annual payment (most common)
